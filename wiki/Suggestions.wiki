#summary Have you any ideas about evolving the project, feel free to put it here.

Suggestions I've received so far:
  * Gerry (Lowry) [http://groups.google.com/group/moqdisc/tree/browse_frm/thread/bb13508b9fb686d5/534d83cbe27914b8?rnum=1&_done=%2Fgroup%2Fmoqdisc%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2Fbb13508b9fb686d5%3F#doc_47f4ada25fa30b75  suggested] to add samples of legacy mocking. 
_Not sure I like this - the main purpose of the project is to teach newbies how to use "current" approaches. The project contains source code of the frameworks, is should to be up to date, etc.. I'm afraid legacy tricks would just confuse people._

_*Really* cool idea. However, I'm not that strong in other languages to make that part. If
anyone would volunteer for porting the code to VB, it would be great. Likewise, Cobol.NET or L# or [http://www.dotnetpowered.com/languages.aspx anything else] is highly welcome! :) 
  * Your suggestion :)
