  * Gerry (Lowry) [http://groups.google.com/group/moqdisc/tree/browse_frm/thread/bb13508b9fb686d5/534d83cbe27914b8?rnum=1&_done=%2Fgroup%2Fmoqdisc%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2Fbb13508b9fb686d5%3F#doc_47f4ada25fa30b75  suggested] to add samples of legacy mocking. _*Deferred for now*_ 
_Not sure I like this - the main purpose of the project is to teach newbies how to use "today" approaches, and legacy tricks would just confuse people. But time will tell. I'm going defer this idea and to get back to it later, when the project evolves to the point where we can talk about supporting legacy samples._

_Sounds like a great idea and if anyone would volunteer for porting the code to VB or any other language, it would be great. However, it seems that lack of lambdas in VB makes the port impossible._ 
  * Jonathan de Halleux [http://code.google.com/p/mocking-frameworks-compare/issues/detail?id=1 suggested] to cover [http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Peli/Getting-started-with-Pex-in-Visual-Studio-2008/ Pex] as well. *_Done (zip to be ready in 1-2 days)_*
_And ultimately Jonathan implemented it himself :) Great stuff!_ 
  * Your suggestion :)
